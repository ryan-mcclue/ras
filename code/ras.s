@ CSI - camera, DSI - display

@ NOTE(Ryan): Learning assembly
@ 1. CISC/RISC, endianness
@ 2. word size, instruction sizing, general/special registers

@ Addressing types are just ways in which we can store/transfer data between locations
@ We have immediate, register direct, direct, 
@ register indirect:
@   1. ldr r1, [r0, #4]
@   2. ldr r1, [r0, #4]! (pre-increment r0 as well)
@   3. ldr r1, [r0], #4 (post-increment r0 as well)
@ register indirect no arithmetic like in x86, so for multiplication (array accessing):
@ mov r2, [r0, r1, lsl #2]
@ add r1, r1, #1

@ twos-complement is used for signed numbers (MSB is negative). 
@ however, we can also treat as unsigned
@ so, require different status flags to indicate for each.
@ carry flag if too big for unsigned (however, also set if subtraction >= 0)
@ overflow if too big for signed

@ barrel shifter in ALU allows to include shifts in instructions, e.g. move and multiply

@ an arm coprocessor is a bit of a misnomer. 
@ it's just extended functionality, e.g. MMU, hardware floating point etc.
@ p15 is system control (cache, MMU), p14 is debug (breakpoint)
@ generic coprocessor instruction like: MCR p10, 0, r1, cr2, 0 (p10 is single-precision coprocessor, p11 is double)
@ or may have more informative like: FMSR s4, r1
@ documentation often in the cortex-specific manual

@ SomePiGuy@gmail.com

@ could update stack with: str! r0, sp, 4


@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): Although '.syntax unified' allows us to not prepend immediates with '#'
@ I don't like having to append 's' to instructions to change flags. 
@ So, prefer default '.syntax divided'

@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): What I know about the PI's GPU bootloader:
@   1. Handles clock initialisation
@   2. Copies our binary from flash to RAM at 0x00008000
@ Writing to VTOR register to alter isr-vector table location is only available for cortex-m.
@ So, we must copy isr-vector table to default 0x00000000

@ TODO(Ryan): If arm procedure call standard says SP 8-byte aligned for ldrd,
@ does this mean always have to push/pop in pairs? yes!
@ push {r4, r5} ‚ü∑ pop {r4, r5} (pop works from right to left)

@ TODO(Ryan): Investigate how to analyse linux source code to obtain this information. 
@ Methods to obtain non-discoverable hardware: 
@  1. Directly in code
@  2. ACPI tables (used by x86 provided by firmware, i.e motherboard BIOS)
@  3. Device tree (.dts compiled to .dtb) (arch/<arm>/boot/dts)
@ inspect on system inside /sys/firmware

@ reg = <base-address size>

@ the device tree specification describes generic format?
@ the compatible property describes the device tree binding that is being implemented

@ board in .dts, soc in .dtsi

@ label: node-name
@ labels used as phandles, i.e. way for properties to reference node.
@ this allows to override node property without replicating node hierarchy  
@
@ sub nodes will typically take node@0 syntax?

@ uboot and barebox sync/copy linux kernel device tree files?
@ Perhaps, have to load in VM and obtain with user-space programs like $(gpioinfo)?

@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): The CPU is a coprocessor of the GPU, therefore different peripheral
@ access addresses depending on source. Due to poor documentation, easier to inspect
@ base addresses inside of linux device tree files.

@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): PC when debug stepping holds current instruction being executed.
@ However, during execution, it will hold two instructions ahead of current instruction.
@ This becomes important for analysing PC relative (ldr r0, [pc + #12])

@ We have a literal pool, which is an area of memory residing in same place as code
@ Arm can only load an immediate 8-bit value (as has fixed sized instruction, and each instruction has shifter, comparison, etc.)
@ For ease, just use ldr r0, =511 construct?

@ C performs arithmetic shift for signed and logical for unsigned

@ inspect with $(objdump -d file.elf)
@ verify on bin with $(hexdump -C file.bin)

@ Reading assembly docs:
@ Mnemonic{s}{Condition} Rd, Rn, <Operand2>
@ {} is optional. <condition> can be EQ. <operand> means various addressing modes possible
@ if instruction suffixed with 's', e.g. adds ; condition flags set 

@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): All instructions are conditional, e.g. suffixed with condition like:
@ cmp r3, #0
@ addeq r5, r5, #1

@ TODO(Ryan): How does ring-levels come into play with bare-metal?

@ risc will have more registers as typically less instructions to work directly with memory, only registers

@ TODO(Ryan): Can be in arm mode (32-bit) or thumb mode (16-bit; however thumb2 can use some 32-bit for branching?)
@ thumb gives less ram accesses and instruction cache misses, cpu uses less power

@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): Although the following load/store sub-word size, they zero-extend:

@ For actual sub-word operations, use MOVT (for high half) and BFI/UBFX (for generic)

@ IMPORTANT(Ryan): When writing assembly, go from python while(), to ifs with gotos 

@ sp is top of stack (so lower address)
